    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this data exploration was to look into survival rates among passengers aboard the Titanic. With this data set we were able to so a deep dive into the factors that may have contributed to having a higher likelihood of survival. Things like: class, port departure, sex, family size, and fare paid to board the ship are all represented in this dataset which allowed us to isolate various factors and examine if there was relationship between those factors and survival. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was a relatively clean dataset but there were some things that needed to be adjusted and those are shown in the work below.\n",

    "There are a few things that seem to be driving the survival rate of this dataset. The first is gender. Women survived at a much higher rate than men. Almost 3 in 4 women survived while fewer than 1 in 5 men survived. The second major driver of survival was being in 1st or 2nd class. Being a 1st or 2nd class female passenger resulted in a survival rate of over 90%. If you were in 2nd class, having a family helped your survival rate as it seems like the people on the ship were keen to save children. Port of departure appeared to drive survival rate a bit, with a departure from port C having a higher survival rate, however, your port of departure was also highly correlated with the class of the ticket you purchased so it seems like the class of ticket is explaining that much more than the port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, being a woman or wealth resulted in your greatest chance of survival, and having children would also help."
